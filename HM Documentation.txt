Task Overview
The task is to create a web application for a hospital management system. The system should provide functionalities for creating doctor accounts, adding patient records, and facilitating quick access and search of patient records.

Task Details
The hospital management system should include the following features:

1. User Registration and Authentication:
   - Allow doctors to create accounts with their personal information.
   - Implement user authentication to ensure secure access to the system.

2. Doctor Dashboard:
   - Provide a dashboard for doctors to view their profile information and manage their account settings.

3. Patient Record Management:
   - Allow doctors to add and update patient records, including details such as name, age, gender, contact information, medical history, and treatment plans.
   - Implement validation and ensure data integrity for patient records.

4. Search and Access Patient Records:
   - Provide a search functionality to quickly locate patient records based on criteria such as name, patient ID, or specific medical conditions.
   - Display patient records with relevant details for easy access and review.

5. User Roles and Permissions:
   - Implement different user roles (e.g., doctor, admin) with varying levels of access and permissions to ensure data security and privacy.
   - Define role-based access control to restrict unauthorized actions.

6. User Interface Design:
   - Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface for easy navigation and efficient data entry and retrieval.
   - Consider usability principles and best practices for effective user interaction.

Task Steps
Follow the steps below to implement the hospital management system:

Step 1: Project Setup
1. Create a new Django project using the `django-admin` command or Django project template in your preferred IDE or command-line interface.
2. Set up the project's database configuration and other necessary settings.

Step 2: User Registration and Authentication
1. Create a user registration form for doctors to create their accounts.
2. Implement user authentication using Django's built-in authentication system or a custom solution.
3. Set up login and logout functionality for user sessions.

Step 3: Doctor Dashboard
1. Create a doctor profile view to display and allow editing of doctor-specific information.
2. Implement account settings functionality, such as changing passwords or updating personal details.

Step 4: Patient Record Management
1. Design the database schema to store patient records, including relevant fields and relationships.
2. Create forms and views to handle the creation, modification, and deletion of patient records.
3. Implement necessary validation and data integrity checks for patient records.

Step 5: Search and Access Patient Records
1. Develop a search functionality that allows doctors to search patient records based on specified criteria.
2. Display search results with relevant patient information and provide links to access detailed records.

Step 6: User Roles and Permissions
1. Define user roles, such as doctor and admin, and assign appropriate permissions.
2. Restrict access to specific views or functionalities based on user roles.

Step 7: User Interface Design
1. Design and implement intuitive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and  Django frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) for enhanced usability.
2. Ensure responsive design to support various screen sizes and devices.

Conclusion
By following the steps outlined in this documentation, you can create a comprehensive hospital management system that allows doctors to create accounts, manage patient records, and search for specific records. Remember to test your application thoroughly, address security considerations, and consider additional features or enhancements based on specific project requirements.
